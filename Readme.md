Myriam was my dream app ever since I started iOS Development. It is my gift to the iOS Hacking Community :)
Myriam is an iOS App contaning various vulnerabilities for you to discover and exploit. The application offers a few challenges
for those of you who wanna become the next iOS hackers. Ranging from In-App Data modification to App Activation Bypass and Jailbreak Detection,
Myriam combines some of the greatest challenges for the beginners out here.
